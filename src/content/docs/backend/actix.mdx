## First actix.rs backend

[Install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

```
cargo new new-project

cargo run
```

[Actix documentation](https://actix.rs/docs/getting-started/)

main.rs
```
use actix_web::{get, post, web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};

#[get("/")]
async fn hello() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello world!")
}

#[get("/hello2")]
async fn hello2() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello 2")
}

#[post("/echo")]
async fn echo(req_body: String) -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(req_body)
}

async fn hello3() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello 3")
}

async fn manual_hello() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hey there!")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .service(hello)
            .service(hello2)
            .service(echo)
            .route("/hey", web::get().to(manual_hello))
            .route("/hello3", web::get().to(hello3))
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}
```

## Actix + JWT + MongoDb



Cargo.toml for a Rust project named actix-web-jwt-example which appears to be a web application possibly with JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication using the Actix web framework.

```
[package]
name = "actix-web-jwt-example"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["emreyalvac <emre.stress@gmail.com>"]
edition = "2018"

# See more keys and their definitions at https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html

[dependencies]
actix-web = "3.0.0-alpha.1"
actix-rt = "1.0.0"
mongodb = "0.9.2"
bson = "0.14.1"
lazy_static = "1.4.0"
serde = "1.0.105"
serde_json = "1.0.48"
jsonwebtoken = "7.1.0"
envfile = "0.2.1"
chrono = "0.4.11"
rust-crypto = "0.2.36"
uuid = { version = "0.8", features = ["serde", "v4"] }
futures = "0.3.4"
```

Let's discuss your dependencies:

Actix-Web & Actix-RT: You're using the alpha version of Actix-Web 3, which is quite dated now. Actix-Web has had several updates since. If you're not depending on specific features of this alpha version, I'd recommend updating to a stable version.

MongoDB & BSON: These are for interacting with a MongoDB database.

Lazy Static: Allows you to create lazily evaluated statics in Rust.

Serde & Serde JSON: Serde is a framework for serializing and deserializing data. In this context, you're likely using it for JSON handling (hence, the inclusion of serde_json).

JSON Web Token: This crate is for encoding and decoding JWTs, probably used for authentication in your web application.

Envfile: Helps with reading .env files, likely for configuration.

Chrono: A date and time library for Rust.

Rust-Crypto: A cryptography library. However, I'd advise caution with using rust-crypto as it is no longer maintained. Consider switching to the ring crate or another actively maintained crypto library.

UUID: A library to create and parse universally unique identifiers, with specific features for serialization and version 4 UUIDs.

Futures: Provides the foundational building blocks for asynchronous programming in Rust.
